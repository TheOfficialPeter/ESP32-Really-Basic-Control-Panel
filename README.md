# ESP32-Really-Basic-Control-Panel

Compile this source code onto your ESP32 (mine is the NodeMCU ESP32). It will deploy a local website which you can visit by entering the ESP32's local IP address and you will be shown the control panel. Pictures below 

Images will be added once the project is finished
