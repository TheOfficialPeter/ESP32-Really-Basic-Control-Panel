# ESP32-Really-Basic-Control-Panel

Compile this source code (right now there's only the HTML code. I am working on adding it to the .ino code) onto your ESP32 (mine is the NodeMCU ESP32). It will deploy a local website which you can visit by entering the ESP32's local IP address and you will be shown the control panel. Pictures below 

Final images will be added once the project is finished. I will be adding more features as I learn more.

Here's the initial design images

### Quick notice

I tend to update my README's more than anything else on github so you'll know when something's wrong/broken or when I stopped working on projects. This project's current status has changed to: Working on this again real soon ;)
